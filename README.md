# RSU Capital Gains Standardization  

*A product proposal to simplify RSU reporting in Indian Income Tax filings (Schedule CG).*  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Employees receiving **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)** in India face major challenges during tax filing:  

- Broker exports come in inconsistent formats.  
- Manual re-entry into **Schedule CG** can require 30â€“40 rows for a single sale.  
- High risk of errors and dependency on Chartered Accountants.  

This repository proposes an **industry-wide standardized export schema** for RSU capital gains reporting. Itâ€™s a **product-focused solution** aimed at improving employee experience, reducing errors, and enabling better compliance.

## ðŸš© Problem  
- Inconsistent broker reports make filing time-consuming and error-prone.  
- Fractional shares and multiple acquisition dates add complexity.  
- Even professionals struggle to report accurately.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution  
- Standardized RSU Export Schema aligned with Schedule CG  
- Brokers auto-generate ITR-ready exports  
- Filing platforms support direct upload  
- Employees: **Download â†’ Upload â†’ Done âœ…**
